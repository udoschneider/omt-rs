# Open Media Transport (OMT) Metadata Specification Document 1.0

This document contains recommended metadata specifications for use with Open Media Transport.

If you have a specification you would like to see listed here, submit a request under this repositories Issues section.

* [PTZ Control](#ptz-control)
* [Ancillary Data](#ancillary-data)
* [Metadata Grouping](#metadata-grouping)

## Web Management

This defines a web management interface for a sender device.

Receivers should implement a way to browse to this address on request.

```xml
<OMTWeb URL="http://x.x.x.x/" />
```

## PTZ Control

This defines what PTZ protocol is available for a PTZ camera device.
The following supported protocols are currently defined:

### Sony VISCA over IP

This is the standard VISCA over IP udp protocol implemented separately to OMT.

```xml
<OMTPTZ Protocol="VISCAoverIP" URL="visca://x.x.x.x:port"  />
```

### Sony VISCA (Inband)

This is the standard VISCA over IP protocol encapsulated within OMT metadata.
Sequence is the same sequence number as used in the original protocol messages.

**Command** 

This is a command sent from controller to camera in hexadecimal format. 

```xml
<OMTPTZ Protocol="VISCA" Sequence="22" Command="8101040700FF" />
```

**Reply**

This is a reply from camera sent back to controller and is in hexadecimal format.

```xml
<OMTPTZ Protocol="VISCA" Sequence="22" Reply="0011AABBCC" />
```

## Ancillary Data

The following is a proposal for sending and receiving raw SDI ancillary data over OMT.
This should ideally be sent in per frame metadata with grouping as per **Metadata Grouping** below.

Payload is in hexadecimal format.

```xml
<AncillaryData xmns="urn:anc:1.0">
<Packet did="45" sdid="01" field="1" line="21" horizOffset="0" st2110Channel="0" pts90k="32109876" link="A" stream="VANC">
<Payload>81010A011E0000</Payload>
</Packet>
</AncillaryData>
```
## Metadata Grouping

To send multiple disparate pieces of metadata within a single frame, use the following grouping syntax.

```xml
<OMTGroup>
<OMTPTZ Protocol="VISCA" Sequence="22" Reply="0011AABBCC" />
<AncillaryData xmns="urn:anc:1.0">
<Packet did="45" sdid="01" field="1" line="21" horizOffset="0" st2110Channel="0" pts90k="32109876" link="A" stream="VANC">
<Payload>81010A011E0000</Payload>
</Packet>
</AncillaryData>
</OMTGroup>
```
Since grouping may not exist when only a single element is sent, it is recommended that any parsing code look for both formats.
